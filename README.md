## **Language Identification using Deep Learning**

This repository is created and developed for the term project of EE578 "Speech Processing" course offered by Prof. Murat Saraçlar of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at Boğaziçi University in 2017 Spring Term.

Using spectrogram features is a common approach for speech processing tasks. CNNs and RNNs are used in this project to classify the speech signals according to their respective languages. The results and report will be provied on request.
